Welcome to my Decision Tree pet project! Classification algorithms involving decision trees are something I find quite interesting and fun, so I want to keep track of my various implementations.

Currently, I have included my ID3 Decision Tree and Random Forest implementations. I still have some refactoring I hope to do on these in the future, in particular writing some tasty tests. 

Basic building/running instructions:

javac *.java
java DecisionTreeContainer
java RandomForestRunner

Also included is the SPECT Heart Dataset textfile from UCI Machine Learning Repository:
